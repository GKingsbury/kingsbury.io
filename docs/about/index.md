# About Me

Hey. Welcome to my site. My name is Grant Kingsbury. I am a full stack developer with over 7 years of experience. I love building new things. I'm always trying to find new technologies that makes my job easier, faster, and enjoyable. 

I work closely with customers gathering and delivering requirements on time, while responding to user feedback. I take pride in the work I produce and I take user and customer feedback seriously while making sure their needs and requirements are being met. I have worked on and managed small teams using agile design to build and maintain full stack web applications from the ground up.
